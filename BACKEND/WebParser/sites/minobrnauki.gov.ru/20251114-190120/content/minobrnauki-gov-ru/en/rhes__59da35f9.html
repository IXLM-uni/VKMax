A graduate is awarded a postgraduate certificate with the corresponding qualification («Research Fellow», «Research Teaching Fellow»).

This can be done as part of a Bachelor&#x27;s (up to 4 years), Specialist (up to 6 years), or Master&#x27;s (at least 2 years) Degree. The selection process is based on entry examinations. Upon graduation, a certificate is awarded to confirm the qualification.</p>
